The main challenges was scraping the data from the internet. We were successful for the types and names of the pokemon but not fully successful in the move/ability section.
The code scrapes for the abilities but takes from the #ID and any language that is avaliable. We did not have time, since there was too much data, to fix this. For some reason it also is scraping the pokemon names and calling them abilities and this is unintentional. 

We learned how to import and analyze data from external sources(ie the internet)
We also took a lot of information from class to help with our project.

The most fun aspect was seeing it all (somewhat) work and having the voice to text actually speak. 
We both enjoyed this project and working with each other. If we had more time and more complex skills, this project could be really cool!
