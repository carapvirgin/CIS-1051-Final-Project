# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Pok√©mon: The Echoes of Generations

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A battle simulator that allows each player to choose which generation they are battling with. Players choose from every gen possible and it creates a small group to battle with. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will promt the player to choose a generation and choose their favorite type pokemon. The player can choose up to 6 types. The choice will then generate a random pick of 6 pokemon to battle with. 
AI voice announcer to read the outcomes of each battle. Back and forth play style between 2 players. Play until opponents pokemon run out (out of 6 ). Use the pokedex database for all the information on moves, damage, abilities and HP.
Indicate the HP bar for all pokemon battling at the end of each turn. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Cara Virgin, tun83319@temple.edu    TA: Kora Sen
Christopher Mejia-Gonzales, tuo45455@temple.edu     TA: Kora Sen

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

picking the gens and pciking the team at random. As well as the AI announcer

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

HP bars, abilities, and other special quailities that individual pokemon have. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Create a visual aspect similar to the old gameboy style

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The next step would be to research how to add in the pokedex for each generation as well as how to add in the AI commentator. The new skills are working with these external datasets from the internet. 
Chris will be adding each gen seperatly using the national pokedex database. Also will add the HP bars.
Cara will be adding in the commentator as well as adding in the randomiser to the decks once they are chosen. Will add in the smal special abilities and such.
If time allows both will learn how to animate for the visual aspect and learn together on how to do this and which programs to use. This could also be done using turtle to create a small "battle field".
